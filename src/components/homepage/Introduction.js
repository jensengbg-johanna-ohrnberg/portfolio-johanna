            <p>My name is Johanna Ã–hrnberg and I am a student studying to become a Front-End Developer.
                I am graduating in June 11th and I'm looking for a new challenge.
                I am looking for a job that can continue to develop my skills as well as teach me more.
                I'm a person who wants to help other people grow as well as the company or team I'm working with.
                I want to take part of others knowledge as well as sharing mine with others.
                At the moment I am doing my Master Thesis for a company called FrontEgdeIT where I am helping them to create a newer version of their website together with two classmates.
